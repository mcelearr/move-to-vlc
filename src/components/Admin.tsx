      To get 'on the system' there are a few admin tasks that I recommend
      tackling in this order. I tried to do most of these on my own and got
      pretty burned by the bureaucracy but in the end I managed it, so it's all
      doable. In Spain it's typical to employ someone, known as a 'Gestor', who
      speaks the language and knows their way around the system to help you with
      these admin tasks. Scroll down to the section 'Speak to an advisor' if you
      would like to speak to a Gestor.
