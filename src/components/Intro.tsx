    <p className="font-light mb-2">Hi I'm Rory ðŸ‘‹,</p>
    <p className="font-light mb-2">
      In 2018 I moved to Spain. Thereâ€™s so many things I love about this country
      from the culture to the food to the weather. But when I first arrived I
      spent so much time struggling with little things that seemed needlessly
      complicated. Endless booking appointments on Government websites with
      contradictory information. Endless hours on the phone to the bank with my
      6 months of Spanish classes under my belt.

      'I wish someone would summarize what I need to do into clean, modern web
      interface!'
    </p>
    <p className="font-light mb-2">
      I cried out more than once. That's why I started this website, 'Move to
      Valencia'. My aim is to give you a clear roadmap for how to get
      established here in Valencia from your NIE, to your phone number to your
      bank account, and to connect you with expert professionals who can advise
      you on immigration and taxes.

    <p className="font-light">Welcome!</p>
